# Open Graph Image Builder

An experimental Web app project for making social cards with JAMstack + serverless architecture. Built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS.

[Read about why and how](https://hoyci.unessa.net/2020/01/open-graph-tool/) on my blog.

### Some ideas for improvements

- Separate text position and styling (add better position controls)
- Add ability to save and distribute (allow linking to) designs
- Implement image rendering with Puppeteer or similar proper backend tool
- Add an UI for adding layers
- Add possibility of using Markdown instead of HTML
- ~~Add ability to use plain color backgrounds instead of images~~ (done in 0.2.0)
